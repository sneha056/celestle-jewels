                    <p><strong><u>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</u>&nbsp;</strong><br>When you visit the Site, we
                        automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web

                        Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or
                        products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information
                        about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as
                        “Device Information”.</p>
                    <p>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>“Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an
                            anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies,
